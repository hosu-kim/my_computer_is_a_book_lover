## Overview
`my_computer_is_a_book_lover` is a C tool designed to efficiently read the contents of a file one line at a time. It focuses on handling file I/O operations in C, utilizing dynamic memory management to ensure each line is read and processed effectively. This tool is ideal for developers who need precise control over file reading operations and efficient memory usage.
## Features
- Reads a line from a file descriptor.
- Handles multiple calls to return successive lines.
- Manages memory dynamically to accommodate varying line lengths.
## Files
- `get_next_line.c`: Contains the main logic for reading lines from a file descriptor.
- `get_next_line_utils.c`: Utility functions used by get_next_line.c, such as string manipulation and memory management functions.
- `get_next_line.h`: Header file containing function prototypes and necessary includes.
## Functions
### `get_next_line.c`
- `line_into_storage(int fd, char *line_storage)`: Reads from the file descriptor and appends the data to the line storage.
- `extract_line(char *line_storage)`: Extracts a single line from the line storage.
- `new_line_storage(char *line_storage)`: Updates the line storage after a line has been extracted.
- `get_next_line(int fd)`: Main function to be called by the user, which coordinates the reading, extracting, and updating of lines from the file descriptor.
### `get_next_line_utils.c`
- `ft_strlen(const char *s)`: Returns the length of a string.
- `ft_strchr(const char *s, int c)`: Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of a character in a string.
- `ft_strdup(const char *s1)`: Returns a duplicate of the provided string.
- `ft_strjoin_and_free(char *s1, const char *s2)`: Joins two strings and frees the first string.
- `ft_bzero(void *s, size_t n)`: Sets a block of memory to zero.
## Usage
To use the get_next_line function, include get_next_line.h in your C program and call get_next_line with the file descriptor you wish to read from.

Example:
```c
#include "get_next_line.h"
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int fd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);
    if (fd == -1)
        return (1);
    
    char *line;
    while ((line = get_next_line(fd)) != NULL)
    {
        printf("%s", line);
        free(line);
    }
    close(fd);
    return (0);
}
```
## Compilation
To compile the `get_next_line` function, you can use the following command:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=1024 get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c -o get_next_line
```
